# Notes:
# Some fields require units. Units are represented as objects from mm.units module.
# Simple units are parsed directly. For example: 
# HR_R0_PARAM = 0.2 nanometer
# But more complex units does not have any more sophisticated parser written, and will fail.'
# In such cases the unit is fixed (and noted in comment), so please convert complex units manually if needed.
# <float> and <int> types does not require any unit. Quantity require unit.

# Default values does not mean valid value. In many places it's only a empty field that need to be filled.
